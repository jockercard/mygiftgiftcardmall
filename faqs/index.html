  <h1>GiftCardMall/MyGift FAQs — Gift Card Balance &amp; More</h1>
  <p>Get clear answers to popular questions about your <strong>GiftCardMall/MyGift</strong> card, including how to <a href="/#tab-balance" style="color:#0066cc;">check gift card balance</a>, <a href="/#tab-register" style="color:#0066cc;">register your card</a>, understand applicable charges, card expiry, and how to handle disputes at <strong>Gift Card Mall</strong>.</p>

  <h2>1. What steps do I take to sign up my GiftCardMall/MyGift card?</h2>
  <p>Head to the main page and select the "Register Card" option. Fill in your 16-digit card number, the expiry date (MM/YY), and the 3-digit CVV located on the reverse of your card. After you submit these details, your card will be set up and prepared for web-based and telephone transactions.</p>

  <h2>2. How do I look up my card balance?</h2>
  <p>You can view your balance at any point by choosing the "Check Balance/Transactions" option on our main page. Provide your card information to see your remaining funds and latest purchase history. You may also call the support line shown on the back of your card as an alternative.</p>

  <h2>3. Does my card come with any charges?</h2>
  <p>Your GiftCardMall/MyGift card may carry specific charges, such as an initial purchase fee upon activation and a recurring maintenance charge following 12 months without use. Check the Cardholder Agreement included with your card for a full breakdown of all applicable fees.</p>

  <h2>4. Will my card stop working at some point?</h2>
  <p>An expiry date is displayed on the front of your card. While the money loaded onto it generally does not expire, the physical card itself will become inactive once that date passes. You can reach out to the support team before the expiry to request a new card and have any leftover funds transferred over.</p>

  <h2>5. My card is missing or was taken &mdash; what do I do?</h2>
  <p>If your card goes missing or is stolen, get in touch with the support team right away by calling the number listed on the card or within your cardholder documents. You may be eligible for a replacement card with your remaining balance moved over, pending identity confirmation and any relevant fees.</p>

  <h2>6. Is my GiftCardMall/MyGift card valid for web-based shopping?</h2>
  <p>Absolutely! After completing registration, your card is ready for online shopping at participating stores. Just make sure the billing address you entered during sign-up is identical to the one used at checkout &mdash; mismatches are a common reason for payment rejections.</p>

  <h2>7. What caused my payment to be rejected?</h2>
  <p>Payments can be turned down for a variety of reasons: not enough funds, incorrectly entered card details, a card that hasn't been activated or has expired, or limitations set by the retailer. Confirm that your card is active and registered, double-check your billing address, and verify that your balance covers the full amount including any temporary holds or gratuities.</p>

  <h2>8. How can I challenge a charge on my card?</h2>
  <p>If you spot a charge you didn't authorize or that looks incorrect, go to the "Track Disputes" option on our main page or call the support line. You'll need your dispute reference number, the last 4 digits of your card, and the ZIP code on file to check your case status online. Most disputes reach a resolution within 30 to 45 days.</p>
